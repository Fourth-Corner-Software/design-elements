#Logo Designs (potential-logo-designs.svg)

These are potential logo possibilities for Fourth Corner Software.

The image is separated into 100x100 squares, with each square representing
either an icon or an empty space.

Each potential logo should have a background and highlight color 
and use a few variations of them as possible.

**Background:** Should be darker and easy on the eyes.
**Highlight:** Should be used minimally, to accent parts of the logo.

Current Colors (#rrggbbaa):
	* **Background:** #a72626ff
	* **Highlight:** #e9f1dfff

The top row contains base patterns.
Each column holds variations on its base pattern.
Each additional row is a style of variation on the base designs.

Current base patterns (left-to-right):
	1. Rotated-star with 4th corner highlighted
	2. Square with 4th corner fully highlighted
	3. Square with 4th corner border-highlighted
	4. Downward-facing pentagon with 4th (bottom) corner highlighted.

Current row styles (top-to-bottom):
	1. Base
	2. Base + Inverted Color Scheme
	3. Base + Color Blend/Gradient (Ugly)
	4. Base + Subltle Inset Shadow
	
##Conventions:
	* potential-logo-designs.svg should be edited only with Inkscape (for now).
	* Use the guides to snap elements.
	* Changes to potential-logo-designes.svg should be documented in this file (LOGODESIGNS.md) in each commit.
	* Logos should have minimum 5px border between their edge and the guide.
	* Each row may have a background object and color, but it should either be white or black.
	* Additional base designs should clearly follow an angular geometric shape with the fourth corner (clockwise from the top-left corner), marked with the highlight color in a clear way.
	* If you add a base design, please fill in all variation styles for it as well.
	* Feel free to change the main colors. I'm terrible at making good palettes.
